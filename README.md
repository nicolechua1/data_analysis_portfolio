# data_analysis_portfolio
This repository serves as a showcase of my skills, a platform to share my projects, and a way to track my progress in Data Analytics and Data Science-related topics.

List of projects:

1. Covid Analysis -- Exploratory data analysis on covid death and vaccination data with SQL. Joins, CTEs, temp tables and views were used to store data for later Visualizations in Tableau. Finished dashboard: https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/nicole.chua/viz/covid_dashboard_16799955390630/covid_dashboard

2. Data cleaning -- Cleaned Nashville housing data with SQL. Standardized date format, populated missing address data, split full address into columns with substring & split_part, fixed inconsistent data fields, removed duplicates and deleted unused columns in cleaned dataset.

3. Movie Industry Correlations Analysis -- *In progress* Conducting linear regression on Movie Industry data using Python (pandas, numpy, seaborn, matplotlib).
