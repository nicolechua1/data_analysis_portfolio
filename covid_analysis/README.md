# Covid Data Analysis

In this project, I explored the trends of coronavirus infections, death and vaccination rates with SQL and Tableau. 
Joins, CTEs, temp tables and views were used to analyze and then store data for Visualizations in Tableau.  
Finished dashboard: https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/nicole.chua/viz/covid_dashboard_16799955390630/covid_dashboard
